### Abstract
An attributed network is a network in which in addition to the network structure each
node is associated with a set of attributes. Community detection in such networks
involves recovering the clusters by simultaneously using the network data and the node
attributes. This research proposes a generic objective function and adopts the gradient
descent (GD) approach to recover clusters in attributed networks. Our straightforward
adoption of GD, even in its improved version, such as the adaptive moment estimation
method, may encounter ”bad sequences” of objects and converge to points that are far
from optimal. To tackle this issue, we introduce a special ”filter” mechanism, which
culls potentially misleading objects. We empirically evaluated and compared the
performance of our proposed methods using synthetic and real-world datasets, including
one new real-world dataset. Our results show that our proposed filter mechanism does
improve results significantly and makes it competitive versus state-of-the-art algorithms.
